telehash implemented in pure javascript
=======================================

To try it out in any browser, put these files on any web server and load fieldtest/index.html, or even from your local filesystem via file:///path-to-thjs/fieldtest/index.html.

If you're looking to use this in node, check out the [node-telehash](https://github.com/telehash/node-telehash) package (`npm install telehash`).

An example of it as a chrome app/extension making use of the native UDP networking is in the [chrome](chrome) folder.

The crypto that powers this is only possible thanks to the incredible work done by the team behind [Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) and [Tom Wu](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/).
